## High Elves Army Builds
 
The High Elves are a noble and ancient race that value order, magic, and diplomacy. They have access to some of the most powerful and versatile units in the game, such as dragons, phoenixes, swordmasters, and archers. They also have a unique mechanic called Influence, which allows them to manipulate other factions through diplomacy or espionage.
 
The High Elves are best suited for a balanced army that can adapt to any situation. They have strong melee units that can hold the line, such as spearmen and swordmasters, as well as excellent ranged units that can deal massive damage from afar, such as archers and bolt throwers. They also have access to powerful magic users that can buff their allies or debuff their enemies, such as mages and loremasters.
 
A typical High Elf army might look something like this:
 
- 1x Lord (preferably a prince or princess with a dragon mount)
- 1x Hero (preferably a mage or loremaster)
- 4x Spearmen (cheap and reliable frontline units)
- 4x Swordmasters of Hoeth (elite melee units that can slice through armor)
- 4x Archers (basic but effective ranged units)
- 2x Bolt Throwers (siege weapons that can target large enemies or buildings)
- 2x Dragons (powerful flying units that can breathe fire)
- 2x Phoenixes (fast and agile flying units that can heal themselves)

This army can handle most threats with ease. The spearmen can form a defensive line to protect the archers and bolt throwers, while the swordmasters can flank and charge the enemy. The dragons and phoenixes can fly over the enemy lines and target their vulnerable units or leaders. The lord and hero can provide leadership and magic support to their troops.
 
## Dark Elves Army Builds
 
The Dark Elves are a twisted and cruel race that revel in war, slavery, and torture. They have access to some of the most ruthless and aggressive units in the game, such as witch elves, executioners, hydras, and black dragons. They also have a unique mechanic called Murderous Prowess, which grants them a temporary boost in combat when they inflict enough casualties.
