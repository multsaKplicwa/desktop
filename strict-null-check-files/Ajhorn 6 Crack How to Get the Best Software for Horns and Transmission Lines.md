AJHorn 6 is a software program that allows you to design and optimize any loudspeaker, especially horns and transmission lines. It is based on the acoustic theory of horns and transmission lines, and uses a graphical user interface to make the simulation process easy and intuitive. You can choose from a variety of drivers, enclosures, horns, filters, and other parameters, and see the results in frequency response, impedance, phase, distortion, directivity, and more. You can also compare different designs and export your data to other applications.

AJHorn 6 is developed by AJ-Systems, a German company that specializes in loudspeaker simulation and measurement. AJ-Systems was founded by Andreas Jakob in 1998, and has since released several versions of AJHorn with new features and improvements. AJHorn 6 is the latest version of the program, released in 2012. It offers several innovations, such as:
 
- A new driver database with over 1000 tested drivers from various manufacturers.
- A new simulation mode for known enclosures, such as bass reflex, closed box, bandpass, etc.
- A new option to simulate multiple drivers in parallel or series.
- A new option to simulate passive crossovers with resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
- A new option to simulate active crossovers with digital signal processors (DSPs).
- A new option to simulate baffle diffraction effects.
- A new option to simulate room acoustics and speaker placement.
- A new option to simulate sound pressure level (SPL) at different distances and angles.
- A new option to simulate power handling and thermal compression.
- A new option to simulate nonlinear distortion (THD) and intermodulation distortion (IMD).

AJHorn 6 is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10. It requires a minimum of 512 MB of RAM and 100 MB of hard disk space. It supports English and German languages. You can download a free demo version of AJHorn 6 from the AJ-Systems website[^1^] [^2^], or order a full version for 119â¬ (now 109â¬) that includes a CD-ROM and a manual[^1^] [^2^]. AJHorn 6 is a must-have tool for anyone who is interested in loudspeaker design and optimization.
  
AJHorn 6 is not only a simulation tool, but also a learning tool. It helps you to understand the principles and concepts of loudspeaker acoustics, such as horn theory, transmission line theory, filter design, crossover design, and more. It also provides you with useful tips and hints on how to improve your designs and avoid common mistakes. You can also access a comprehensive online help system that explains every feature and function of the program.
 
AJHorn 6 is also a versatile tool that can be used for various applications and purposes. You can use it to design your own custom loudspeakers for home, studio, or professional use. You can use it to modify and optimize existing loudspeaker designs or models. You can use it to test and measure your loudspeaker drivers and enclosures. You can use it to simulate different listening scenarios and environments. You can use it to create stunning presentations and reports of your designs and simulations.
