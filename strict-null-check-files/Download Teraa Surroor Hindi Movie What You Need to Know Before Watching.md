Teraa Surroor is a fast-paced and stylish film that showcases Himesh Reshammiya's skills as an actor, singer and composer.

You can also buy or rent the DVD or Blu-ray from online or offline stores. Teraa Surroor is a movie that will keep you entertained and engaged till the end.
  
However, Teraa Surroor is not a film that will impress the critics or the discerning audience. The film has many flaws and loopholes that make it hard to take seriously. The script is weak and full of clichÃƒÂ©s, the dialogues are cheesy and corny, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, and the logic is missing in many scenes. The film also suffers from poor editing and continuity errors that affect the flow of the story.
 
The film tries to be a stylish and slick thriller, but ends up being a mess of genres and tones. The film shifts from romance to comedy to drama to action without any coherence or consistency. The film also fails to create any suspense or thrill, as the twists and turns are predictable and unoriginal. The film relies heavily on Himesh Reshammiya's star power and music, but neither of them are enough to save the film from being a disaster.
 
Teraa Surroor is a film that might appeal to the fans of Himesh Reshammiya, who enjoy his songs and his action avatar. But for the rest of the audience, it is a film that can be easily skipped or watched at your own risk. Teraa Surroor is a film that does not live up to its title or its genre. It is a film that disappoints on all levels and leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth.
