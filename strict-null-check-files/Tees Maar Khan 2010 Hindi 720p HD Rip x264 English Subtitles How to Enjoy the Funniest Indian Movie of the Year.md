The plot of Tees Maar Khan follows Tabrez Mirza Khan, a notorious con artist who has escaped from the police several times with his clever tricks and disguises. He is hired by a pair of international smugglers, Johri Brothers, to rob a train carrying antiques and treasures worth â¹500 crore. To accomplish this task, Tabrez decides to use a fake film crew and a village full of innocent people as his cover.
 
He convinces the villagers that he is making a patriotic film about their freedom fighter ancestor, and casts them as extras. He also hires a famous but arrogant actor, Aatish Kapoor (Khanna), to play the lead role of the freedom fighter. Tabrez's girlfriend, Anya (Kaif), is an aspiring actress who dreams of becoming a superstar like Sheila (a cameo by Anil Kapoor), and hopes that this film will be her big break.
 
However, things get complicated when Tabrez falls in love with the village headman's daughter, Jhumri (Ragini Khanna), and Aatish develops feelings for Anya. Tabrez also faces challenges from the police inspector Dhurinder (Murli Sharma), who is determined to catch him, and the villagers, who begin to suspect his true intentions. Will Tabrez be able to pull off the heist and escape with the loot? Or will he be caught red-handed by the law or betrayed by his own crew?
  
Tees Maar Khan is a film that offers a mix of comedy, action, romance, and drama. The film showcases the talent of Akshay Kumar, who delivers a hilarious performance as the cunning and charismatic Tabrez Mirza Khan.
