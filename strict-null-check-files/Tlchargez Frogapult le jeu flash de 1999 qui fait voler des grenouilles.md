If you are looking for a fun and nostalgic game to play on your PC, you might want to check out Frogapult, a classic flash game from 1999. Frogapult was developed by NStorm, the same company that created the popular Elf Bowling series. The game is simple but addictive: you have to launch frogs with a catapult and try to land them on a platform without getting eaten by piranhas or an alligator. The game features colorful graphics, funny sound effects, and a catchy soundtrack.

Despite these issues, NStorm's games still have a loyal fan base and a cult following. Many people still remember and appreciate their games for their originality and humor. Some people even consider them to be classics or guilty pleasures of flash gaming. NStorm's games are also part of the history and culture of flash gaming and casual gaming.
