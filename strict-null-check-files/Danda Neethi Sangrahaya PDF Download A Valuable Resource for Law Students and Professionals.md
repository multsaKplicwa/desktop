## How to write SEO optimized articles
  
Now that you know how to get the Danda Neethi Sangrahaya PDF online, you might be wondering how to write SEO optimized articles for your own website or blog. SEO writing is not just about inserting keywords into your content, but also about creating valuable and engaging content that matches the search intent of your target audience. Here are some tips on how to write SEO optimized articles:
  
- Do keyword research: Before you start writing, you need to find out what keywords your potential readers are searching for and what kind of content they expect to find. You can use tools like SEMrush[^1^], Ahrefs[^2^], or Backlinko[^3^] to find relevant keywords and analyze the competition.
- Craft your page title: Your page title is one of the most important elements of SEO writing, as it tells both search engines and users what your page is about. Your page title should include your main keyword and a benefit or value proposition for the reader. It should also be catchy and concise, ideally between 50-60 characters.
- Create an SEO friendly URL: Your URL is another important element of SEO writing, as it helps search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of your website. Your URL should include your main keyword and be descriptive and easy to read. It should also avoid unnecessary words, symbols, or parameters.
- Write the content: Once you have your keywords, title, and URL ready, you can start writing your content. Your content should be long enough to cover the topic in depth, but not too long that it becomes boring or repetitive. A good rule of thumb is to aim for at least 1000 words per article. You should also use headings, subheadings, bullet points, images, videos, and other formatting techniques to make your content more readable and scannable.
- Add your keywords in the first paragraph: One of the best practices of SEO writing is to include your main keyword in the first paragraph of your content, preferably in the first sentence. This helps search engines and users quickly identify what your page is about and whether it matches their query.
- Create headings using long-tail keywords: Headings are another way to optimize your content for SEO and improve its readability. Headings help you break down your content into sections and subtopics, making it easier for users to skim through and find what they are looking for. You should use long-tail keywords in your headings, as they are more specific and less competitive than head keywords.
- Add LSI-related keywords to your content: LSI stands for latent semantic indexing, which is a technique that search engines use to understand the context and meaning of words on a page. LSI-related keywords are synonyms or variations of your main keyword that help you avoid keyword stuffing and create more natural and relevant content. You can use tools like LSI Graph or Answer The Public to find LSI-related keywords for your topic.
- Link to other pages on your website using relevant anchor text: Internal links are links that point from one page on your website to another page on your website. Internal links help you boost the authority and relevance of your pages, as well as improve the user experience and navigation. You should link to other pages on your website using relevant anchor text, which is the clickable text that contains the link. Your anchor text should describe what the linked page is about and include a keyword if possible.
- Demonstrate your expertise and authority on the subject (E-A-T): E-A-T stands for expertise, authority, and trustworthiness, which are factors that Google uses to evaluate the quality and credibility of a website or a page. E-A-T is especially important for topics that affect people's health, safety, or finances, also known as YMYL (your money or your life) 8cf37b1e13
