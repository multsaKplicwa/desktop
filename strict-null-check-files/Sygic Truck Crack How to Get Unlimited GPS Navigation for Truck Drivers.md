## Custom Routing According to Vehicle Parameters
 
One of the most important features of Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation is that it allows you to customize your routes according to your vehicle type, size, weight, number of trailers, and other settings. You can choose from four vehicle options: Truck, RV/Bus, Van, or Car.

You can use metric, imperial, or U.S. units.
 
By entering these details, Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation will calculate the best route for your vehicle and prevent you from running into hazards like low bridges or narrow streets. It will also avoid roads that are not suitable or restricted for your vehicle type or load settings. For example, if you are driving a truck with explosives, it will avoid tunnels or residential areas. If you are driving an RV or a caravan, it will avoid roads with sharp curves or steep gradients.
